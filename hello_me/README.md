
1. The class used to implement the controller pattern is SnappingSheetController.
We can control the sheet by and mostly the SnappingPositions, by reading from it and modifying it.

2. The parameter that controls the animation curve is 'snappingCurve'

3. The advantages are the following:
For GestureDetector - It is broader and gives more control and features over the widget than InkWell
(such as dragging).
For InkWell - Includes ripple effect tap, and also splash effect, as opposed to GestureDetector.
